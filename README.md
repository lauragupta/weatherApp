# weatherApp

This app provides users with current weather and forecasts for cities all across the world. The user is provided with information about temperatures, humidity levels, windspeed, and even a UV index that is color coded to alert the user to dangerous UV levels. After a user searches a city, that city is stored in local storage and creates a button for the user to search again.
